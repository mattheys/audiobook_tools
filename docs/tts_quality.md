This is my opinion on TTS services and software.

#Best
These are often similar to natural speaking
-*** mimic3 (software) - best software based, voice qualities vary. See below. Proccessing is slow but still 10x real-time.
- Google Cloud TTS: WaveNet voices (online) - the best I've heard


#High quality
These sound good, but is still artificial
- Google Cloud TTS: standard voices (online) - fairly good, quality is better than average.
- MS Azure TTS (online) - farily good, quality is better than average.
- Amazon Polly (online) - fairly good, quality is better than average.


#Average quality
These sound ok, obviously artificial, and occasionally hard to understand
- VoiceRSS TTS (online) - Voice quality is average (between robotic and natural). Not as good as MS Azure/Amazon Polly/Google Cloud
- marytts (software) - pitch warbles between words
- Coqui TTS (software) - sounds great in a single phrases, but has intermiten odd pauses and slowed words when reading chapters.  Proccessing is slow but still 10x real-time. 


#Lower quality
These are very robotic, and often are dificult to understand.
- Google Translate TTS (online) - robotic voices
- espeak (software) - robotic voices
- festival (software) - robotic voices
- CMU Flite/festival-lite (software) - https://github.com/festvox/flite - robotic, but less than some

#Untested
- IBM Cloud (online)-  https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech
- Google Cloud TTS: Neural2 voices (online) - https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech
