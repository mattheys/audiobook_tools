It was <emphasis level="moderate">frickin’ cold </emphasis>outside, but Ryoka let not a trace of that show on her face. She wasn’t equipped for the winter; she was still in this world’s equivalent of a t-shirt and running leggings. But once she started running she’d warm up.<break time="200ms"/>
No time to start like the present, then. Ryoka took a few steps into the snow and began to jog. The snow was loose and powdery around her boots. It was like running in the sand<break time="200ms"/>and even harder because of the boots. It would take Ryoka quite some time to get back north.<break time="200ms"/>

Ryoka heard the voice, but she only raised one hand in farewell. She continued to accelerate until she was going at a decent clip. Soon, the inn was lost behind her as Ryoka ran up and down snow-covered mounds, heading back towards the main road.<break time="200ms"/>
